# ssh-manager
Manages your password based ssh connections

You store your connections credentials inside context folder

Then it searchs for files and ask to which to choose.
Then sends password with 'expect' to pass through password enter phase
Then bam you are inside

This is an early imlpementation. It lacks controls of inputs.

For future, I am going to implement giving commands with their sudo pwd etc.
